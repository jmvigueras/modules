# Deployment LoadBalancers for a Fortigate Cluster deployment on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction

This module IaC is a part of a full deployment of a Fortigate cluster in a sandwich configuration. This terraform code will deploy an External Load Balancer (ELB), Internal Load Balancer (ILB) and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). (It is only necessary an external and internal loadbalancer for a Fortigatet cluster, but GWLB it is also deployed for demo purpose.  

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - IMPORTANT: for this deployment be suscceful, it is necesary IP and IDs of Fortigate cluster network interfaces. Deploy first fortigate cluster with module fgt-ha.
   - External Load Balancer with a new public IPs and backend public fortigate cluster interfaces. (BackEnd configured with provided public network interfaces of fortigates)
   - Internal Load Balancer with an internal IP in private subnet and backend with private fortigate cluster interfaces. (BackEnd configured with provided public network interfaces of fortigates)
   - Gateway Load Balancer with with an internal IP in private subnet and backend using fortigate cluster privates IPs. The backend is configured with VNI identifier 800 for internal and 801 for external traffic, using 10800 and 10801 upd ports respectively for vxlan config. 


## Deployment considerations:
      - Create file terraform.tfvars using terraform.tfvars.example as template 
      - Update variables in var.tf with fortigate cluster deployment
      - You will be charged for this deployment


## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Create module with source `source = "github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/xlb`
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `vars.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary:
```sh
Outputs:

ilb_private-ip          = <ILB private IP>
elb_public-ip           = <ELB public IP>
gwlb_frontip_config_id  = <GWLB front-end configuration id>
```

## Destroy the deployment
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
