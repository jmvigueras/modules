# Deployment Fortigate site spoke on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction

This terraform code will deploy a fortigate site, simulating and on premise site connected to HUB over different WAN connections.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0


## Deployment overview
It is highly recomended to used other modules as inputs to generate necessary variables for this module. Check example to see how to use modules `vnet-fgt` and `vm`.
   - module vnet-fgt (`github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/vnet-fgt`)
   - module vm (`github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/vm`)

Needed to update vars_hubs.tf
   - Complete data of each HUB to connect with SDWAN Fortinet as list of collections as it is showed here:

   ```sh
      variable "hubs" {
      type = list(map(string))
      default = [
         {
            id         = "HUB1"           // id (will be used as zone Id)
            bgp-asn    = "65001"          // hub bgp ASN
            public-ip  = "11.11.11.11"    // public IP to connect 
            hub-ip     = "172.20.30.1"    // hub IP in IPSEC tunnel
            site-ip    = "172.20.30.12"   // sit IP in IPSEC tunnel
            hck-srv-ip = "172.20.30.1"    // IP server to check health check
            advpn-psk  = "secret"         // IPSEC PSK
            cidr       = "172.20.30.0/24" // Net range of HUB 
         },
         {
            id         = "HUB1"
            bgp-asn    = "65001"
            public-ip  = "11.11.11.12"
            hub-ip     = "172.25.30.1"
            site-ip    = "172.25.30.12"
            hck-srv-ip = "172.25.30.1"
            advpn-psk  = "secret"
            cidr       = "172.25.30.0/24"
         },
         {
            id         = "HUB2"
            bgp-asn    = "65002"
            public-ip  = "22.22.22.22"
            hub-ip     = "172.25.30.1"
            site-ip    = "172.25.30.12"
            hck-srv-ip = "172.25.30.1"
            advpn-psk  = "secret"
            cidr       = "172.25.30.0/24"
         }
      ]
      }
   ```
      - Update site details:
   ```sh
      variable "site" {
      type = map(any)
      default = {
         id      = "site-1"           // site id
         cidr    = "192.168.0.0/20"   // site cidr range
         bgp-asn = "65011"            // bgp asn for site (same as hub for iBGP)
         ha      = true               // (true|false), true for fortigate in HA deployment 
      }
      }
   ```

## Deployment considerations:
   - Create file terraform.tfvars using terraform.tfvars.example as template 
   - Update variables in var.tf with fortigate cluster deployment
   - You will be charged for this deployment

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Create module with source `source = "github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/vnet-spoke`
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `vars.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary:
```sh
Outputs:

<Detail info of VNETs and Subnet deployed>
```

## Destroy the deployment
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
