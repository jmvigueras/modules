# Deployment of a VNET to act as spoke of a Fortigate Cluster deployment on the Azure with Terraform
## Introduction

This module IaC is a part of a full deployment of a Fortigate cluster in a sandwich configuration. This terraform code will deploy spoke VNETs with preconfigured subnets: subnet-1, subnet-2, GatewaySubnet, RouterServer, PrivateLinkSubnet, PrivateLinkServicesSubnet. Network Security Groups and interfaces in subnet-1 y subnet-2 of each VNET are also created, for attached to future test VM deployed in those subnets.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - Update vars.tf with CIDR blocks for each VNET you want to deploy

## Deployment considerations:
   - Create file terraform.tfvars using terraform.tfvars.example as template 
   - Update variables in var.tf with fortigate cluster deployment
   - You will be charged for this deployment

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Create module with source `source = "github.com/jmvigueras/modules/azure/vnet-spoke`
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `vars.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary:
```sh
Outputs:

<Detail info of VNETs and Subnet deployed>
```

## Destroy the deployment
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
