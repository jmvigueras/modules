# Deployment of FortiGate-VM (PAYG/BYOL) Cluster on the AWS with 3 ports
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a standalone FortiGate-VM on AWS with 3 ports 

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider AWS 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template 2.2.0
* Needs to have FOS v7.0 later that supports the hasync/hamgmt single port feature.


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A AWS VPC with 4 subnets in one AZ (Public, Private, MGMT and Servers)
   - One FortiGate-VM (PAYG) instance with three NICs. (port1 - mgmt, port2 - public, port3 - private).
   - Four Network Security Group rules: external fortigate interface, one for internal and management and other for servers.
   - 3 network interfaces for Fortigate
   - 1 network interface for test Server

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

url           = https://fgt_mgmt_IP:admin_port
ip            = <fgt management public IP>
admin_port    = <admin port>
api-token     = <generated random API token>
username      = <admin>
password      = <defaul password fgt instance id>

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
