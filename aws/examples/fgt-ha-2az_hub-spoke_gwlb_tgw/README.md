# Forigate cluster deployment in 2 AZ with 1 cluster as SDWAN spoke other as HUB
## Introduction

This deployment will establish a comprehensive SDWAN environment consisting of a HUB and a spoke. The spoke will consist of an active-active Fortigate Cluster (FGSP) deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), where traffic will be forwarded from the VPC spoke to a Transit Gateway (TGW). The cluster will serve as the backend for a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB), and endpoints will be deployed in the VPC to handle traffic from the TGW. The HUB cluster will be deployed in a separate VPC, configured as an FGCP cluster, and IPSEC tunnels will be established over the Internet.

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Check particulars requiriments for each deployment (AWS) 

## Deployment Overview

- New VPC with subnets in each AZ: Management (MGMT), Public, Private, Bastion, TGW and GWLB. (Only MGMT, Public and Private are needed for this setting).
- Fortigate cluster: 2 instances with 3 insterfaces each one and 2 EIP for management associated to MGMT interface and 1 EIP associated to active public interface.
- Bastion linux instance.
